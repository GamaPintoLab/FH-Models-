# FH-Models-
Top 10 models for the manuscript Correia et al.

## Description
Classification models that were trained with a paediatric sample of the Portuguese Familial Hypercholesterolaemia study, which comprise both FH-positive and FH-negative individuals. The FH-positive individuals fullfil the clinical criteria of Simon Broome and present a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in a known FH-related gene (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9). On the other hand, FH-negative individuals fullfil the SB criteria but do not present a positive genetic test for FH.  
This set of models corresponds to the best ten models acquired during the work of Correia et al. and they are able to predict the classification of individuals as FH-positive or FH-negative with a sensitivity range of 0.73-0.91 and a specificity range of 0.60-0.92.

## Usage
Each model can be downloaded as .rda file and then can be applyied to a new dataset using the code within the provided R script.
